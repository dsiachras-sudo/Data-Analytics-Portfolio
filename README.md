# Financial Systems & Data Analytics Portfolio

### 👨‍💼 About Me
I am a Financial Systems Specialist and **US Citizen** based in Europe with 15+ years of experience in Treasury, Payroll, and Operations. Currently pursuing a M.S. in Analytics at Georgia Tech.

### 🚀 What I Do
I bridge the gap between messy financial data and clear business decisions. I specialize in upgrading manual Excel workflows into automated Python/R pipelines, cleaning data for reporting, and building predictive models for finance.

### 📂 Projects in this Repository

#### Financial & Business Modeling (R)
* **`Censored_Data_Tobit_Model.R`**
    * **The Problem:** Standard regression fails when data is "capped" at zero (e.g., insurance claims, household spending).
    * **The Solution:** Implemented a Tobit Regression model to correctly analyze censored financial data without bias.

* **`Customer_Segmentation_Clustering.R`**
    * **The Problem:** Identifying distinct customer groups without predefined labels.
    * **The Solution:** Used K-Means clustering algorithms to segment customers based on income and spending behavior.

#### High-Performance Computing (Python)
* **`High_Speed_Data_Processing.py`**
    * **The Problem:** Processing large financial datasets (1M+ rows) in Excel is too slow.
    * **The Solution:** A high-speed NumPy script that uses vectorization to calculate Z-scores and Euclidean distance instantly, replacing slow loops.

#### Machine Learning & Algorithms (R)
* **`Text_Relevance_Classifier.R`**
    * **The Solution:** An NLP pipeline that automates document sorting (News vs. Ads) using Logistic Regression and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA).

* **`Movie_Recommender_System.R`**
    * **The Solution:** A collaborative filtering engine that builds personalized recommendation lists based on user similarity scores.
